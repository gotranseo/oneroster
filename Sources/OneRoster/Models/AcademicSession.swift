/// AcademicSession represent durations of time. Typically they are used to describe terms, grading periods, and other durations e.g. school years.
/// Term is used to describe a period of time during which learning will take place. Other words for term could be in common use around the world e.g.
/// Semester.
///
/// The important thing is that Term is a unit of time, often many weeks long, into which classes are scheduled. Grading Period is used to
/// represent another unit of time, that within which line items are assessed. A term may have many grading periods, a grading period belongs to a
/// single term. A class may be assessed over several grade periods (represented by a line item being connected to a grading period). The parent /
/// child attributes of academic sessions allow terms to be connected to their grading periods and vice-versa.
